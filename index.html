    <h1>Diabetes Management</h1>
    <p><strong>Diabetes</strong>, often referred to by doctors as <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong>, describes a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar), either because insulin production is inadequate, or because the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, or both. Patients with high blood sugar will typically experience polyuria (frequent urination), they will become increasingly thirsty (polydipsia) and hungry (polyphagia).</p>

  <h2>Fast facts on diabetes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Diabetes is a long-term condition that causes high blood sugar levels.</li>
    <li>In 2013 it was estimated that over 382 million people throughout the world had diabetes. There were 458,900 cases of diabetes in Kenya in 2017.</li>
    <li>TIf you have Type 1 and follow a healthy eating plan, do adequate exercise, and take insulin, you can lead a normal life.</li>
    <li>Type 2 patients need to eat healthily, be physically active, and test their blood glucose. They may also need to take oral medication, and/or insulin to control blood glucose levels.</li>
    <li>As the risk of cardiovascular disease is much higher for a diabetic, it is crucial that blood pressure and cholesterol levels are monitored regularly.</li>
    <li>As smoking might have a serious effect on cardiovascular health, diabetics should stop smoking.</li>
    <li>Hypoglycemia - low blood glucose - can have a bad effect on the patient. Hyperglycemia - when blood glucose is too high - can also have a bad effect on the patient.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>

  <h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>
  <p>The body does not produce insulin. Some people may refer to this type as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile diabetes, or early-onset diabetes. People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years.

    Type 1 diabetes is nowhere near as common as type 2 diabetes. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1.</p>

    <p>Patients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin
     injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.</p>
     <h2>Type 2 diabetes</h2>
     <p>The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function, or the cells in the body do not react to insulin (insulin resistance). Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are type 2.</p>
      <p> Overweight and obese people have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a healthy body weight. People with a lot of visceral fat, also known as central obesity, belly fat, or abdominal obesity, are especially at risk. Being overweight/obese causes the body to release chemicals that can destabilize the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.</p>
       <p>Some people may be able to control their type 2 diabetes symptoms by losing weight, following a healthy diet, doing plenty of exercise, and monitoring their blood glucose levels. However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the patient will probably end up have to take insulin, usually in tablet form.</p>
       <p>The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also greater as we get older. Experts are not completely sure why, but say that as we age we tend to put on weight and become less physically active. Those with a close relative who had/had type 2 diabetes, people of Middle Eastern, African, or South Asian descent also have a higher risk of developing the disease.</p>
        <p>Men whose testosterone levels are low have been found to have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, say that low testosterone levels are linked to insulin resistance.</p>

         <h2>Type 3 Gestational diabetes</h2>
         <p>This type affects females during pregnancy. Some women have very high levels of glucose in their blood, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in progressively rising levels of glucose.
           Diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made during pregnancy.</p>
          <p>The majority of gestational diabetes patients can control their diabetes with exercise and diet. Between 10% to 20% of them will need to take some kind of blood-glucose-controlling medications. Undiagnosed or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can raise the risk of complications during childbirth. The baby may be bigger than he/she should be.</p>
          <p>Scientists from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University found that women whose diets before becoming pregnant were high in animal fat and cholesterol had a higher risk for gestational diabetes, compared to their counterparts whose diets were low in cholesterol and animal fats.</p>
          <h2>Prediabetes</h2>
          <p>The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes initially had prediabetes. Their blood glucose levels where higher than normal, but not high enough to merit a diabetes diagnosis. The cells in the body are becoming resistant to insulin. Studies have indicated that even at the prediabetes stage, some damage to the circulatory system and the heart may already have occurred.</p>

          <h1>Symptoms of Diabetes</h1>
          <p>It is possible to have diabetes with only very mild symptoms or without developing any symptoms at all. Such cases can leave some people with diabetes unaware of the condition and undiagnosed. This happens in around half of people with type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <ol> <strong>Common symptoms of diabetes</strong>
            <li>Frequent urination</li>
            <p>Have you been going to the bathroom to urinate more often recently? Do you notice that you spend most of the day going to the toilet? When there is too much glucose (sugar) in your blood you will urinate more often.</p>
            <p>If your insulin is ineffective, or not there at all, your kidneys cannot filter the glucose back into the blood. The kidneys will take water from your blood in order to dilute the glucose - which in turn fills up your bladder.</p>
            <li>Disproportionate thirst</li>
            <p>Over drinking water than usual. If you are urinating more than usual, you will need to replace that lost liquid. You will be drinking more than usual.</p>
            <li>Intense hunger</li>
            <p>As the insulin in your blood is not working properly, or is not there at all, and your cells are not getting their energy, your body may react by trying to find more energy - food. You will become hungry.</p>
            <li>Weight gain</li>
            <p>This might be as a result of over eating due to intense hunger and increased apettite</p>
            <li>Unusual weight loss</li>
            <p>This is more common among people with Diabetes Type 1. As your body is not making insulin it will seek out another energy source (the cells aren't getting glucose). Muscle tissue and fat will be broken down for energy. As Type 1 is of a more sudden onset and Type 2 is much more gradual, weight loss is more noticeable with Type 1.</p>
            <li>Increased fatigue</li>
            <p>If your insulin is not working properly, or is not there at all, glucose will not be entering your cells and providing them with energy. This will make you feel tired and listless.</p>
            <li>Irritability</li>
            <p>Irritability can be due to your lack of energy.</p>
            <li>Blurred vision</li>
            <p>This can be caused by tissue being pulled from your eye lenses. This affects your eyes' ability to focus. With proper treatment this can be treated. There are severe cases where blindness or prolonged vision problems can occur.</p>
            <li>Cuts and bruises don't heal properly or quickly</li>
            <p>Do you find cuts and bruises take a much longer time than usual to heal? When there is more sugar (glucose) in your body, its ability to heal can be undermined.</p>
            <li>More skin and/or yeast infections</li>
            <p>When there is more sugar in your body, its ability to recover from infections is affected. Women with diabetes find it especially difficult to recover from bladder and vaginal infections.</p>
            <li>Itchy skin</li>
            <p>A feeling of itchiness on your skin is sometimes a symptom of diabetes.</p>
            <li>Gums are red and/or swollen - Gums pull away from teeth</li>
            <p>If your gums are tender, red and/or swollen this could be a sign of diabetes. Your teeth could become loose as the gums pull away from them.</p>
            <li>Frequent gum disease/infection</li>
            <p>As well as redening and pulling away of gums, you may experience more frequent gum disease and/or gum infections.</p>
            <li>Sexual dysfunction among men</li>
            <p>If you are over 50 and experience frequent or constant sexual dysfunction (erectile dysfunction), it could be a symptom of diabetes.</p>
          </ol>
          <h1>Diabetes Diagnosis</h1>
          <p>Diabetes can often be detected by carrying out a urine test, which finds out whether excess glucose is present. This is normally backed up by a blood test, which measures blood glucose levels and can confirm if the cause of your symptoms is diabetes.</p>

          <h3>Facts and Myths about Diabetes</h3>
          <p>Many presumed "facts" are thrown about in the paper press, magazines and on the internet regarding diabetes; some of them are, in fact, myths. It is important that people with diabetes, pre-diabetes, their loved ones, employers and schools have an accurate picture of the disease</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>People with diabetes should not exercise</strong> - NOT TRUE!! Exercise is important for people with diabetes, as it is for everybody else. Exercise helps manage body weight, improves cardiovascular health, improves mood, helps blood sugar control, and relieves stress. Patients should discuss exercise with their doctor first.</li>

            <li><strong>Fat people always develop type 2 diabetes eventually</strong> - this is not true. Being overweight or obese raises the risk of becoming diabetic, they are risk factors, but do not mean that an obese person will definitely become diabetic. Many people with type 2 diabetes were never overweight. The majority of overweight people do not develop type 2 diabetes.</li>

            <li><strong>Diabetes is a nuisance, but not serious</strong> - two thirds of diabetes patients die prematurely from stroke or heart disease. The life expectancy of a person with diabetes is from five to ten years shorter than other people's. Diabetes is a serious disease.</li>

            <li><strong>Children can outgrow diabetes</strong> - this is not true. Nearly all children with diabetes have type 1; insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas have been destroyed. These never come back. Children with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin for the rest of their lives, unless a cure is found one day.</li>

            <li><strong>Don't eat too much sugar, you will become diabetic</strong> - this is not true. A person with diabetes type 1 developed the disease because their immune system destroyed the insulin-producing beta cells. A diet high in calories, which can make people overweight/obese, raises the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, especially if there is a history of this disease in the family.</li>

            <li><strong> know when my blood sugar levels are high or low </strong>I- very high or low blood sugar levels may cause some symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue and extreme thirst. However, levels need to be fluctuating a lot for symptoms to be felt. The only way to be sure about your blood sugar levels is to test them regularly. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark showed that even very slight rises in blood-glucose levels significantly raise the risk of ischemic heart disease.</li>

            <li><strong> Diabetes diets are different from other people's</strong> - the diet doctors and specialized nutritionists recommend for diabetes patients are healthy ones; healthy for everybody, including people without the disease. Meals should contain plenty of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and they should be low in salt and sugar, and saturated or trans fat. Experts say that there is no need to buy special diabetic foods because they offer no special benefit, compared to the healthy things we can buy in most shops.</li>

            <li><strong> High blood sugar levels are fine for some, while for others they are a sign of diabetes</strong> - high blood-sugar levels are never normal for anybody. Some illnesses, mental stress and steroids can cause temporary hikes in blood sugar levels in people without diabetes. Anybody with higher-than-normal blood sugar levels or sugar in their urine should be checked for diabetes by a health care professional.</li>

            <li><strong> Diabetics cannot eat bread, potatoes or pasta</strong> - people with diabetes can eat starchy foods. However, they must keep an eye on the size of the portions. Whole grain starchy foods are better, as is the case for people without diabetes.</li>

            <li><strong> One person can transmit diabetes to another person</strong> - NOT TRUE. Just like a broken leg is not infectious or contagious. A parent may pass on, through their genes to their offspring, a higher susceptibility to developing the disease.</li>

            <li><strong>Only older people develop type 2 diabetes</strong> - things are changing. A growing number of children and teenagers are developing type 2 diabetes. Experts say that this is linked to the explosion in childhood obesity rates, poor diet, and physical inactivity.</li>

            <li><strong>I have to go on insulin, this must mean my diabetes is severe</strong> - people take insulin when diet alone or diet with oral or non-insulin injectable diabetes drugs do not provide good-enough diabetes control, that's all. Insulin helps diabetes control. It does not usually have anything to do with the severity of the disease.</li>

            <li><strong>If you have diabetes you cannot eat chocolates or sweets</strong> - people with diabetes can eat chocolates and sweets if they combine them with exercise or eat them as part of a healthy meal.</li>

            <li><strong>Diabetes patients are more susceptible to colds and illnesses in general</strong> - a person with diabetes with good diabetes control is no more likely to become ill with a cold or something else than other people. However, when a diabetic catches a cold, their diabetes becomes harder to control, so they have a higher risk of complications.</li>

            <ul>

            <li>Rise, shine, and check your blood sugar</li>
            <p>Check your blood sugar as soon as possible after you wake up. This will give you an idea of what your blood sugar was like overnight. You can correct it right away with food or insulin if you find that it’s too high or too low. You may also consider recording your blood sugar levels and other important information in a diabetes journal. This can help you can keep of track of how well your diabetes is controlled from day to day.</p>
          </div>
            <div class="column">
            <li>Start your day with a healthy breakfast</li>
            <p>Eating well is an important part of managing type 1 diabetes. Start your day off right with a nutritious breakfast that follows your healthy eating plan. A healthy plan for type 1 diabetes typically includes foods from each food group, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats.</p>
            <p>Since you’re taking insulin, you should also include a moderate amount of healthy carbohydrates at each meal. This will prevent your blood sugar from dropping too low. Make sure to keep track of your carbs and match your intake with your insulin dosage, if needed. You can record this information in your diabetes journal.</p>
            <p>Some quick and easy breakfast ideas for people with type 1 diabetes include:<strong> scrambled eggs, oatmeal with low-fat milk, or a fruit and yogurt parfait</strong>. Don’t forget to test your blood sugar before and after each meal, including breakfast.</p>
          </div>
            <div class="column">
            <li>Take your medications</li>
            <p>Remember to take your insulin and any other medications. For busy mornings, it can be helpful to make a diabetes kit with a glucose monitor, insulin, syringes, and any other supplies you need. Being organized will save you time. If you have trouble remembering to take medications, try using a pill box or keeping medications in the bathroom by your toothbrush.</p>
          </div>
            <div class="column">
            <li>Drive safely</li>
            <p>Whether you’re headed to work, school, or running errands, make sure that you get there safely. Check your blood sugar before you get behind the wheel, and never drive if your blood sugar is too low. You should also keep some snacks in your car, including a source of glucose like juice.</p>
          </div>
            <div class="column">
            <li>Have a snack</li>
            <p>You may need to have a mid-morning snack to keep your energy and your blood sugar up. Healthy snack ideas for people with type 1 diabetes include a handful of almonds, a piece of string cheese, or an apple.</p>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <h3>Afternoon</h3>
            <ul>
              <div class="column">
              <li>Eat a healthy lunch</li>
              <p>Check your blood sugar again, and then have a healthy lunch. It may be easiest to eat well if you plan ahead and pack your lunch. Good options include a salad topped with cottage cheese and nuts, hummus and veggies, or a cup of chili. And of course, check your blood sugar again after you eat.</p>
            </div>
              <div class="column">
              <li>Get some exercise</li>
              <p>Staying active is an important part of managing your type 1 diabetes. It can also boost your mood and reduce your stress levels. Some activities you might enjoy include going for a jog, taking your dog for a long walk, or dancing.</p>
              <p>You should get 30 to 60 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Make sure to check your blood sugar before and after you work out. You should also bring a source of glucose with you.</p>
              </div>

              <h3>Evening</h3>
              <div class="column">
              <li>Make dinner</li>
              <p>Eat a nutritious dinner, and don’t forget to check your blood sugar again before and after you eat. If you’re often too tired to make a healthy meal at the end of the day, try planning ahead. Keep your kitchen well-stocked with good food choices. You can also try preparing some parts of your meal when you have more time, like on the weekends.</p>
            </div>
              <div class="column">
              <li>Relax</li>
              <p>Make some time at the end of the day to relax and enjoy yourself. Read a book, watch a movie, or visit a friend. Taking time out every day for yourself is an important part of managing stress and staying healthy.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="column">
              <li>Get some sleep</li>
              <p>Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. Getting enough sleep is especially important for people with type 1 diabetes because lack of sleep makes it harder to control your blood sugar.</p>
              <p>Let your doctor know if you’re having trouble sleeping at night. Sleep problems could be caused by blood sugar that’s too high or too low. Make a habit of checking your blood sugar before you go to bed. If your blood sugar tends to drop at night, it may help to have a snack before bed.</p>
              </div>
            </ul>
          </br>
            </div>
            <h3>Note</h3>
            <p>When you have type 1 diabetes, staying healthy can add extra stress to your already busy day. Planning ahead is the key to managing your diabetes. Follow your daily diabetes schedule to make living well with type 1 diabetes a little easier.</p>
